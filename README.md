Whetherfleura is a cryptid hunting web app
built in two consecutive week-long sprints.
Users can create an account and log in. Much
like Nutshell, a user can create, read, update
and Delete data in the form of "creature
sightings." This project in its entirety was taken
from storyboard concept to operational in 2
weeks using React, JS, HTML, CSS, and SaSS. It
used json-server, a mock RESTful API, for
persistent storage.


# Demo

## Setup

Navigate to `/whetherfleura-capstone/src`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will also need to run a json-server locally. To do so;

../whetherfleura-capstone/
../API/

### `json-server -p 8088 -w database.json`

You will need to extract information from one of the profiles. You can also create your own on the react app once the mock server is running. \
